Hey, Fleur user !

This is Evolution X 11, Android 16 for Fleur, finally !

You can dirty flash it over the Evo11 test builds, if you installed them previously.
Else, please use the recovery to sideload the update, and ignore the verification failed.

A few improvements have been made smoothness-wise since the test builds.

Plus, VoLTE and the jank between the settings menu have been fixed.
A few minor issues like the magnetometer are still there, tho.

Enjoy and #KeepEvolving !
