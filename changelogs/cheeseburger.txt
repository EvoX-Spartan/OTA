Hello OnePlus 5/5T user !

Long time no see, right ?

This is Evolution X 11, Android 16 for OP5 Series, finally !

About flashing.
You can probably dirty flash it over the Evo10 builds, But you will need to go through recovery to do so. I recommend making a save first.

----- What's new ? ------

Well, OnePlus 5 series should be dead. Seriously, it had 4.4 kernel, which couldn't make it for A16.
BUT !!!

Many thanks to Ed, a genius developer, who managed to port kernel 4.14 to oneplus 5.
So yes, this version uses 4.14 and no longer 4.4 !

A few improvements have been made smoothness-wise since the test builds.

Enjoy and #KeepEvolving !
