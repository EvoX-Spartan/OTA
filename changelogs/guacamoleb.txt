Hello !
Long time no see.

In a first part, I would like to apologize.
OnePlus 7 series took a lot of time to be released, I had tons of issues with it.

It's the reason why this version doesn't have some stuff it had before like dolby.
Maybe it'll be back later.

But A16 is finally here ! As per what my testers said, it looks like this version is really nice and clean.

Initial release with November sec patches update.

==================== Known issues ========================
- Choppy QS panel (will be fixed soon)
==========================================================

Installation ------------------------------------>

MAKE A SAVE !!!!! PLEASE !!!!

Dirty flash may work, but I wouldn't recommend it. 
At least it will not work from updater, you need to go to recovery.

Prior flashing, don't forget to flash recovery or boot (depending on your device)
for oneplus 7T/7TPro this is MANDATORY else the device won't flash the update.

Don't wanna go through the hassle ? just clean flash.

Enjoy and #KeepEvolving !

Onelots.
