Hello !

Final update before QPR1, just to have a checkpoint.
Nothing really got added nor removed, just source changes.

And obviously November updates.

If you are coming from my test builds (Android 15 or Android 16) you can dirty flash.

=============================

IF YOU ARE COMING FROM THE OFFICIAL EVOLUTIONX 10.X : PLEASE   __DO NOT__ DIRTY FLASH !!
DIRTY FLASH THIS VERSION OVER THE OFFICIAL 10.X WILL SOFT-BRICK YOUR DEVICE 

Backup your data and clean flash to this version. Thank you.

==============================

Enjoy and #KeepEvolving !

Onelots.
