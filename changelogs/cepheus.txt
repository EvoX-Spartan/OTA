This is the initial A16 release with August 2025 security patches

==============================

Device changes:

- Initial Android 16 release with new device tree, clean flash
  is needed. Please do not use third-party recovery images as
  they are no longer supported and may render your device 
  unbootable.
- Fixed IR blaster
- Enabled AOD wallpaper by default
- Dolby works, MiuiCamera also works (except Portrait mode)
- userdebug build
- Kernel already has KernelSU-Next support with susfs, but is
  disabled by default to comply with Evolution X rules. Check 
  XDA thread or Discord for more information about obtaining root.
- Switched to EROFS as Google apps are getting bigger in size
  and we need to compress them as much as possible.

==============================

Known bugs:

Enabling AOD will default to high brightness, which causes
quicker battery drain. To fix this, do the following steps:

- Enable ADB: Go to Settings > About phone > Tap 7 times on 
  Build number > go back, then go to System > Developer options
  > enable USB debugging (ADB) and Rooted debugging

- Connect your device to your computer, authorize your device
  then type the following commands:

  adb root
  adb shell "echo 1 > /sys/devices/platform/soc/soc\:qcom,dsi-display-primary/doze_mode"

You will need to do this only once per boot.
