Known bugs:

Enabling AOD will default to high brightness, which causes
quicker battery drain. To fix this, do the following steps:

- Enable ADB: Go to Settings > About phone > Tap 7 times on 
  Build number > go back, then go to System > Developer options
  > enable USB debugging (ADB) and Rooted debugging

- Connect your device to your computer, authorize your device
  then type the following commands:

  adb root
  adb shell "echo 1 > /sys/devices/platform/soc/soc\:qcom,dsi-display-primary/doze_mode"

You will need to do this only once per boot.
