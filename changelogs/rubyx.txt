This is Android 16 Update with September 2025 Security Patches

Notes:
=======================
- LineageOS based sources
- Dirty flash works but continue at your own risk.
- Miui Camera has been switched to lag while changing modes and lenses. This is used since it's a better alternative instead of having photos not saved to gallery/photos.
- Kernel synced with latest CIP changes
- ViPER4AndroidFX is added (works alongside Dolby Atmos)
- Play Integrity Fix in rom has been dropped. Use your own methods to fix the play integrity.
